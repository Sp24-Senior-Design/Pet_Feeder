# Pet_Feeder
PROJECT NAME: SMART PET FEEDER
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Our project will be a Smart Pet Feeder, with the purpose of helping pet owners who can’t always be home to interact with or feed their pet. Our device will be programmed by the user through a simple app, allowing the programming of motors to control the amount of food released and also when it is released. There will also be a weight sensor to monitor the food level in the food reserve. Our feeder also allows the owner to use one-way video and two-way audio to monitor their pet from a distance. The video and audio files will be stored on our microcontroller and this data can be sent to the owner's phone in real time using Wi-Fi. For power, our product will be safely powered by using a wall outlet and a voltage regulator. As a result, our product will make pet care more convenient for owners with our product.
PROJECT SPECIFIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (PSDRS):
PSDR #1 (Hardware): An ability to store recorded audio and video over a length of time using SPI.
PSDR #2 (Hardware): An ability to control food dispensing through a motor using PWM.
PSDR #3 (Hardware): An ability to regulate power into the device to a safe level using a voltage regulator.
PSDR #4 (Hardware): An ability to measure the amount of food in the food reserve with a weight sensor and store the data into the device’s memory.
PSDR #5 (Software): An ability to allow users to select a feeding schedule and view audio/video via an app, which will be sent by the feeder via Wi-Fi.
